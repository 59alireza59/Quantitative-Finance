This Quantitative Finance Engineering Project contains Option Pricing and Estimation of Financial Models with R

## Abstract:
This work programs an application of option pricing theory to real data computing different operations on stock and option prices. Despite the existence of some unacceptable assumptions in real leading to some weaknesses for the theory interpretation, this programming work attempts to present a valuable statistical framework with analytical perspective, instead. For doing this, different explorative techniques i.e. clustering and lead-laggards estimation were used to detect some similarities among famous companies in the financial services market, and correspondingly, it shows which of them likely is the market leader as well. Furthermore, this programming check if and how values corresponded to applications of the Black and Scholes model and the Monte Carlo method to price some options, diverge from corresponding market prices. Those values also let us to determine what the main reasons for this divergence are and based on which assumptions. Then, to figure out the best model that to interpret the path followed by the time series of the prices, the AIC method is hired considering some well-known models: Geometric Brownian motion (GBM), Vasicek (VAS), Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) and CKLS. Finally, a different method for option pricing, so-called the Lèvy market model is used. The main reason to select Lèvy market model is that the model takes into account all characteristics that lie outside of the standard Black and Scholes’ assumptions such as some typical feature of prices as jumps, changes in volatility and non-normality of returns.

This platform is programmed to demonstrate in practice which statistical concept can be developed for which part of financial market analysis:

1- Time Series Clustering
2- Lead–lag Effect
3- Black–Scholes Test
4- Change Point Detection
5- Option Pricing
6- Monte Carlo Method
7- Levy Market Process
